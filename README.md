## jack (java like) compiler
This project, developed as part of a Fundamentals_of_Programming_Languages
course, is a compiler for a Java-like programming language. 
It translates source code into VM code and further compiles it into machine code. 
The process involves a series of steps, including source code compilation, VM code generation, 
and finally, the generation of machine code for execution on the target machine.
